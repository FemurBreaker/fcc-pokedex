# freeCodeCamp Pokemon Search App (Pokédex) EXAMPLE

## A fully functional and responsive pokédex for freeCodeCamp's JS Course using PokéAPI written in basic HTML, CSS, and JS!

This project was completed for the last step of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Course/Certification offered by freeCodeCamp. The code fully utilizes the PokéAPI Proxy to showcase every Pokemon from ID 1 to 1025. Every part of this project is sample code to showcase the following:

* Using the PokéAPI Proxy to showcase and display different names, sprites, and stats of Pokemon
* Using JS to manipulate the DOM to display information
* Using vanilla CSS to design and create the Pokedex in a responsive format
* How to use JavaScript fetch, await, and async to pull data from a public API

## How to install and run this project

The easiest way to see how this project works is to use the GitHub Pages website above and run it on your browser. However, if you want to run source code locally, the easiest way to do so is:

1. Clone this project or download the ZIP file
2. Run the code on any local server (ex. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">Live Server</a> for VS Code)

## How to tweak this code for your use case

Since this is an example project, I would highly recommend you try and clone this repo to make your own tweaks to the code. The code here passes all tests on the freeCodeCamp submission page, but **please don't submit this code as your own**, feel free to take inspiration but always try and do things yourself first. This code acts as a pretty good baseline.

## Find a bug? Wanna clean up the Code?
